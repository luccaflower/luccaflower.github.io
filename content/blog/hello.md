Finally got around to registering a domain name and picking a static
site generator to use for my personal site ([11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), if you're curious).

I figured it would be nice to have a place to write about various things I learn along the
way, or silly adventures in technology would be nice, as well as maybe
hosting an online CV of sorts.
